## Description

myTeam is an athletics program management system that allows players, coaches, and admins to focus on the game, rather than team administration. Player and team management modules allow admistrators to roster players and assign coaches, and the scheduling and announcement modules make organizing a breeze. No more group texts or shared calenders - everything you need is right here.

# USER STORY

AS an ATHLETE, I want to be able to keep up real time access to my statistics, team schedule, practice schedule and record.```
